## ✨ What It Does

This agent automatically:

1. **Scrapes** live job postings from LinkedIn (via Playwright browser automation or SerpAPI)
2. **Parses** raw HTML/JSON into structured data — titles, companies, skills, locations, experience levels
3. **Analyzes** the data — role demand, top skills, work-type trends, hiring companies, regional splits
4. **Generates** a full Markdown report + 6 charts + CSV/JSON exports

**Use cases:**
- Understand which tech roles are in highest demand
- See which skills are most requested across thousands of real job listings
- Compare US vs India job markets
- Track hiring trends over the last 24 months
- Research before a job search or career pivot

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.11 or higher | [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **uv** | latest | Fast Python package manager (replaces pip + venv) |
| **OpenAI API Key** | — | Required for analysis & insights |
| **SerpAPI Key** | — | Required only for `--mode serpapi` (recommended) |

> **Don't have uv?** Install it in one command — see [Installation](#-installation) step 1.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Install `uv` (package manager)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

After installing, restart your terminal, then verify:
```bash
uv --version
```

---

### Step 2 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashipk/LinkedIn_Jobs_Research_AI_Agent.git
cd LinkedIn_Jobs_Research_AI_Agent
```

---

### Step 3 — Install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This creates a virtual environment (`.venv/`) and installs all packages from `pyproject.toml` automatically. No need to run `pip install` manually.

---

### Step 4 — Install Playwright browsers

```bash
uv run playwright install chromium
```

> This downloads the Chromium browser used for LinkedIn scraping. Only needed for Playwright mode.

---

## 🔑 API Keys Setup

### OpenAI API Key (Required)

The agent uses OpenAI for LLM-powered insights in the Analyst step.

1. Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new key
3. Set it as an environment variable:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Add the export line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to avoid re-entering it every session.

---

### SerpAPI Key (Required for `serpapi` mode — Recommended)

SerpAPI is the most reliable way to collect real job data. It queries Google Jobs and returns clean structured results.

1. Sign up at [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com/) — free plan gives **100 searches/month**
2. Copy your API key from the dashboard
3. Set it via environment variable **or** in `config.yaml`:

**Option A — Environment variable (recommended, keeps key out of code):**
```bash
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

**Option B — Directly in `config.yaml`:**
```yaml
data_source:
  serpapi:
    api_key: "your_key_here"
```

> ⚠️ **Security:** Never commit your API key to Git. The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env` files. Use environment variables when possible.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings live in `config.yaml`. Open it and customize before running.

### Key Settings

#### Data Source
```yaml
data_source:
  mode: "serpapi"      # "serpapi" (recommended) or "playwright"
  serpapi:
    api_key: "PASTE_YOUR_SERPAPI_KEY_HERE"  # or use SERPAPI_API_KEY env var
    pages_per_query: 1000  # "unlimited" — fetches all available pages per query
```

**How many jobs will I get?**

> 💡 `pages_per_query: 1000` means **"fetch everything available"** — Google Jobs typically caps at 10–30 pages per query, so it won't actually burn 1,000 credits. It just keeps paginating until results run out.
>
> The real lever for getting more jobs is adding more **roles** and **locations** — not `pages_per_query`.

| Roles | Locations | Est. Unique Jobs | Credits Used | Plan Needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | 2 (country-only) | ~500 | ~26 | Free plan ✅ |
| 13 | 12 (cities) | ~2,465 | ~400 | Paid plan |
| **21** | **18 (default)** | **~5,000+** | **~600** | **Paid plan** |
| 21 | 25+ | ~8,000+ | ~900+ | Paid plan |

> Formula: `roles × locations × actual_pages_available ≈ total credits`

---

#### Job Roles to Search
21 roles are configured by default, covering the full spectrum of tech jobs:
```yaml
search:
  roles:
    # Software Engineering
    - "Software Engineer"
    - "Backend Engineer"
    - "Frontend Engineer"
    - "Full Stack Engineer"
    - "Staff Engineer"
    - "iOS Engineer"
    - "Android Engineer"
    # AI / Data
    - "Machine Learning Engineer"
    - "AI Engineer"
    - "Data Engineer"
    - "Data Scientist"
    # Infrastructure / Cloud
    - "DevOps Engineer"
    - "Platform Engineer"
    - "Site Reliability Engineer"
    - "Cloud Engineer"
    - "Infrastructure Engineer"
    # Security & Architecture
    - "Security Engineer"
    - "Solutions Architect"
    # Leadership & Quality
    - "Engineering Manager"
    - "Tech Lead"
    - "QA Engineer"
```

---

#### Locations
18 locations are configured by default — 9 US cities, 7 India cities, plus country-level fallbacks:
```yaml
search:
  locations:
    # Country-level (broad fallback)
    - name: "United States"
    - name: "India"
    # US Cities
    - name: "San Francisco, California"
    - name: "New York, New York"
    - name: "Seattle, Washington"
    - name: "Austin, Texas"
    - name: "Boston, Massachusetts"
    - name: "Chicago, Illinois"
    - name: "Los Angeles, California"
    - name: "Denver, Colorado"
    - name: "Atlanta, Georgia"
    # India Cities
    - name: "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India"
    - name: "Hyderabad, Telangana, India"
    - name: "Mumbai, Maharashtra, India"
    - name: "Pune, Maharashtra, India"
    - name: "Delhi, India"
    - name: "Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"
    - name: "Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India"
```

---

#### OpenAI Model
```yaml
openai:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"          # Used by Parser Agent
  analyst_model: "gpt-4o-mini"  # Used by Analyst Agent
  temperature: 0.2
  max_tokens: 65536
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Agent

### Quick Test (No API keys needed)
```bash
uv run python main.py --demo
```
Runs the full pipeline on **1,000 synthetic jobs** — great for testing the setup before spending API credits.

---

### Real Run with SerpAPI (Recommended)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your_serpapi_key"

uv run python main.py --mode serpapi
```

---

### Real Run with Playwright (LinkedIn direct scraping)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

uv run python main.py --mode playwright
```

> ⚠️ LinkedIn may block automated browsers. If you see CAPTCHAs, switch to `--mode serpapi`.

---

### All CLI Options

```bash
uv run python main.py [OPTIONS]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--demo` | off | Run with synthetic data (no API keys needed) |
| `--mode` | from config | `serpapi` or `playwright` |
| `--config` | `config.yaml` | Path to a custom config file |
| `--output` | `output/` | Directory to save results |
| `--max-pages` | from config | Override `pages_per_query` at runtime |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Demo mode — test the pipeline
uv run python main.py --demo

# SerpAPI with 5 pages per query
uv run python main.py --mode serpapi --max-pages 5

# Custom config file
uv run python main.py --config my_custom_config.yaml

# Custom output directory
uv run python main.py --output ./results/run1
```

```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agents'`
```bash
uv sync
```
Re-runs dependency installation. All packages will be installed into the `.venv/` folder.

---

### `playwright._impl._errors.Error: Executable doesn't exist`
```bash
uv run playwright install chromium
```

---

### LinkedIn blocks scraping / CAPTCHA detected
- Switch to SerpAPI mode: `uv run python main.py --mode serpapi`
- Or try running with a visible browser: set `headless: false` in `config.yaml`
- Increase delay: raise `min_delay` and `max_delay` in `config.yaml`

---

### SerpAPI returns 0 results
- Make sure your key is valid and not expired
- Check you have remaining credits at [serpapi.com/dashboard](https://serpapi.com/dashboard)
- Make sure `SERPAPI_API_KEY` env var is set (takes priority over config.yaml)
- Try: `uv run python main.py --demo` to verify the rest of the pipeline works

---

### OpenAI API errors
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set: `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Check you have API credits at [platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- The pipeline still runs without an API key — insights section will be skipped

---

### `uv: command not found`
Re-install uv and restart your terminal:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.zshrc   # or source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### Virtual environment issues
```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
```
